I added a smoother effect for theme changing so it's less jarring on the eyes when you switch. I also added a fullscreen feature where you can click on the text to read it in fullscreen, which is helpful for those with vision issues. I added a footer giving credit to the original image owners, with an effect saying "Designed by Anthony" as a cool visual. I added a favicon for a more "complete" site feeling.
